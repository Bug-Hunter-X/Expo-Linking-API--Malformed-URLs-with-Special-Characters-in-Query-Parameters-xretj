This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links, specifically when the app is opened from a deep link that includes query parameters with special characters.  The `Linking.getInitialURL()` method might fail to retrieve the correct URL, or the URL received may be malformed.  This frequently leads to unexpected behavior or crashes within the app, especially on Android devices.
